The first two terms in the Fibonacci series are 0 and 1, respectively and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two.

Using this definition to calculate the first several terms in the sequence, we get:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... Find the series up-to 100. Write a pseudocode for the same.
